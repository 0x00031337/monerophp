# Monero Library
Monero Library built with PHP and some coffee!

## How it works
Monero Library (aka Monero_Payments.php) will try to connect to your Monero RPC Daemon (monero-wallet-rpc, See section how to use for more information).
Monero RPC Daemon has a json api that can communicate with Monero Library. Automatically Monero Library will know your address and others things.
